# This is a sample configuration file for running the GeoServer Catalog against a H2 database.
# Adapt the url, user, password, and other configuration options to your set up and rename this
# file as jdbcconfig.properties
#
# Note the initialization DDL script for H2 will be automatically run at startup.
# The initialization script is located in the jdbcconfig_scripts directory, named initdb.h2.sql
# The importCatalog configuration option tells GeoServer whether to import the current catalog from the file system
# to the database or not. If set to true, it will be imported and the config option will be set the value 'false'
# for the next start up to avoid trying to re-import the catalog configuration.
