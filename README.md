# docker-geoserver

A simple docker container that runs GeoServer influenced by this docker
recipe: https://github.com/eliotjordan/docker-geoserver/blob/master/Dockerfile

## Getting the image

There are various ways to get the image onto your system:

The preferred way (but using most bandwidth for the initial image) is to
get our docker trusted build like this:


```shell
docker pull kartoza/geoserver
```
 
### Setting Tomcat properties during build

The  Tomcat properties such as maximum heap memory size are included in the Dockerfile. You need to change them 
them before building the image in accordance to the resources available on your server:

You can change the variables based on [geoserver container considerations](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/production/container.html)

The Docker image is configured to let Java preallocate `2G` of RAM and use up to `4GB` of RAM.
You can change the Java memory allocation using the following build arguments

- `INITIAL_MEMORY` Initial Memory that Java can allocate, default `2G`.
- `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` Maximum Memory that Java can allocate, default `4G`.

```shell
docker build --build-arg INITIAL_MEMORY=1GB -t kartoza/geoserver .
```

> These build arguments operates on the `-Xms` and `-Xmx` options of the Java Virtual Machine

### To build yourself with a local checkout using the build script: 

Edit the build script to change the following variables:

-  The variables below represent the latest stable release you need to build. i.e 2.15.2
   ```
   BUGFIX=2 
   MINOR=15
   MAJOR=2
   ```
```shell
git clone git://github.com/kartoza/docker-geoserver
cd docker-geoserver
./build.sh
```
Ensure that you look at the build script to see what other build arguments you can include whilst building your image.

If you do not intend to jump between versions you need to specify that in the build script.

### Building with war file from a URL

If you need to build the image with a custom GeoServer war file that will be downloaded from a server, you 
can pass the war file url as a build argument to docker, example:
```
docker build --build-arg WAR_URL=http://download2.nust.na/pub4/sourceforge/g/project/ge/geoserver/GeoServer/2.13.0/geoserver-2.13.0-war.zip --build-arg GS_VERSION=2.13.0
```
**Note: war file version should match the version number provided by `GS_VERSION` argument otherwise we will have a 
mismatch of plugins and GeoServer installed.**

### Building with Oracle JDK

Download `jdk-8u201-linux-x64.tar.gz` or the latest version from [Oracle Java](https://www.oracle.com) and save the contents into
the resources folder. This used to be done by the setup scripts but no longer works due to the changes
in the licencing terms from Oracle which require users to login to their site.


To replace OpenJDK Java with the Oracle JDK, set build-arg `ORACLE_JDK=true`:

```shell
docker build --build-arg ORACLE_JDK=true --build-arg GS_VERSION=2.13.0 -t kartoza/geoserver .
```

### Building with plugins

Inspect setup.sh to confirm which plugins (community modules or standard plugins) you want to include in
the build process, then add them in their respective sections in the script.

You should ensure that the plugins match the  version for the GeoServer WAR zip file.

### Removing Tomcat extras during build

To remove Tomcat extras including docs, examples, and the manager webapp, set the
`TOMCAT_EXTRAS` build-arg to `false`:

```shell
docker build --build-arg TOMCAT_EXTRAS=false --build-arg GS_VERSION=2.13.0 -t kartoza/geoserver .
```

### Building with specific version of  Tomcat

To build using a specific tagged release for tomcat image set the
`IMAGE_VERSION` build-arg to `8-jre8`: See the [dockerhub tomacat](https://hub.docker.com/_/tomcat/)
to choose which tag you need to build against.

```shell
docker build --build-arg IMAGE_VERSION=8-jre8 --build-arg GS_VERSION=2.13.0 -t kartoza/geoserver:2.13.0 .
```

### Building with file system overlays (advanced)

The contents of `resources/overlays` will be copied to the image file system
during the build. For example, to include a static Tomcat `setenv.sh`,
create the file at `resources/overlays/usr/local/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh`.

You can use this functionality to write a static GeoServer directory to
`/opt/geoserver/data_dir`, include additional jar files, and more.

Overlay files will overwrite existing destination files, so be careful!

## Run (manual docker commands)

**Note:** You probably want to use docker-compose for running as it will provide
a repeatable orchestrated deployment system.

You probably want to also have postgis running too. To create a running 
container do:

```shell
docker run --name "postgis" -d -t kartoza/postgis:9.4-2.1
docker run --name "geoserver"  --link postgis:postgis -p 8080:8080 -d -t kartoza/geoserver
```

You can also use the following environment variables to pass a 
user name and password. To postgis:

* -e USERNAME=<PGUSER> 
* -e PASS=<PGPASSWORD>

You can also use the following environment variables to pass arguments to GeoServer:


* GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR=<PATH>
* ENABLE_JSONP=<true or false>
* MAX_FILTER_RULES=<Any integrer>
* OPTIMIZE_LINE_WIDTH=<false or true>
* FOOTPRINTS_DATA_DIR=<PATH>
* GEOWEBCACHE_CACHE_DIR=<PATH>
* GEOSERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>


**Note:** 
### Changing GeoServer password on runtime
The default GeoServer user is 'admin' and the password is 'geoserver'. You can pass the environment variable  
GEOSERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD to  change it on runtime.
```shell

docker run --name "geoserver"  -e GEOSERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=myawesomegeoserver -p 8080:8080 -d -t kartoza/geoserver
```

## Run (automated using docker-compose)

We provide a sample ``docker-compose.yml`` file that illustrates
how you can establish a GeoServer + Postgis + Geogig orchestrated environment
with nightly backups that are synchronised to your backup server via btsync.

If you are **not** interested in the backups,Geogig and btsync options, comment 
out those services in the ``docker-compose.yml`` file.

If you start the stack using the compose file make sure you login into GeoServer using username:`admin`
and password:`myawesomegeoserver` as specified by the env file `geoserver.env`

Please read the ``docker-compose`` 
[documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for details
on usage and syntax of ``docker-compose`` - it is not covered here.

If you **are** interested in btsync backups, install [Resilio sync]
on your desktop NAS or other backup  destination and create two
folders:

* one for database backup dumps
* one for geoserver data dir 

Then make a copy of each of the provided EXAMPLE environment files e.g.:

```shell
cp docker-env/btsync-db.env.EXAMPLE docker-env/btsync-db.env
cp docker-env/btsync-media.env.EXAMPLE docker-env/btsync-media.env
```

Then edit the two env files, placing your Read/Write resilio keys
in the place provided.


To run the example do:

```
docker-compose up
```

Which will run everything in the foreground giving you the opportunity
to peruse logs and see that everything spins up nicely.

Once all services are started, test by visiting the GeoServer landing
page in your browser: [http://localhost:8600/geoserver](http://localhost:8600/geoserver).

To run in the background rather, press ``ctrl-c`` to stop the
containers and run again in the background:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

**Note:** The ``docker-compose.yml`` **uses host based volumes** so
when you remove the containers, **all data will be kept**. Using host based volumes 
 ensures that your data persists between invocations of the compose file. If you need
 to delete the container data you need to run `docker volume prune`. Pruning the volumes will
 remove all the storage volumes that are not in use so users need to be careful of such a move.
 Either set up btsync (and test to verify that your backups are working, we take 
**no responsibiliy** if the examples provided here do not produce 
a reliable backup system).

## Run (automated using rancher)

An even nicer way to run the examples provided is to use our Rancher
Catalogue Stack for GeoServer. See [http://rancher.com](http://rancher.com) 
for more details on how to set up and configure your Rancher 
environment. Once Rancher is set up, use the Admin -> Settings menu to 
add our Rancher catalogue using this URL:

https://github.com/kartoza/kartoza-rancher-catalogue

Once your settings are saved open a Rancher environment and set up a 
stack from the catalogue's 'Kartoza' section - you will see 
GeoServer listed there.

If you want to synchronise your GeoServer settings and database backups
(created by the nightly backup tool in the stack), use (Resilio 
sync)[https://www.resilio.com/] to create two Read/Write keys:

* one for database backups
* one for GeoServer media backups

**Note:** Resilio sync is not Free Software. It is free to use for
individuals. Business users need to pay - see their web site for details.


You can try a similar approach with Syncthing or Seafile (for free options) 
or Dropbox or Google Drive if you want to use another commercial product. These
products all have one limitation though: they require interaction 
to register applications or keys. With Resilio Sync you can completely 
automate the process without user intervention. 

## Storing data on the host rather than the container.

Docker volumes can be used to persist your data.

If you need to use geoserver data directory that contains sample examples and configurations download
it from [geonode](http://build.geonode.org/geoserver/latest/) site as indicated below:

```shell

# Example - ${GS_VERSION} is the geoserver version i.e 2.13.0 
wget http://build.geonode.org/geoserver/latest/data-2.13.x.zip
unzip data-2.13.x.zip -d ~/geoserver_data
cp scripts/controlflow.properties ~/geoserver_data
chmod -R a+rwx ~/geoserver_data
docker run -d -p 8580:8080 --name "geoserver" -v $HOME/geoserver_data:/opt/geoserver/data_dir kartoza/geoserver:${GS_VERSION}

```
Create an empty data directory to use to persist your data.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/geoserver_data && chmod -R a+rwx ~/geoserver_data
docker run -d -v $HOME/geoserver_data:/opt/geoserver/data_dir kartoza/geoserver
```

### Control flow properties
The control flow module is installed by default and it is used to manage request in geoserver. In order
to customise it based on your resources and use case read the instructions from 
[documentation](http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/controlflow/index.html). Modify
the file scripts/controlflow.properties before building the image.
